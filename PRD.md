Product Requirements Document (PRD): Federated API-driven Launch Platform

## Overview

The goal is to create a streamlined, API-driven platform akin to Product Hunt but with a simplified user experience. Users submit a single URL, and the platform automatically retrieves metadata, logos, and banner images. Descriptions are AI-generated to ensure uniqueness and SEO optimization. The system is open-source, encouraging organic federation and content distribution.

## Key Features

### Frictionless URL Submission

* Users submit only a URL.
* Automated scraping of meta tags, logos, banner images.
* Descriptions auto-generated with AI (GPT models via Ollama or OpenAI) to ensure uniqueness and SEO effectiveness.

### Federated Submission Process

* Platform owners can monetize submissions through:

  * A one-time fee for individual directory submissions.
  * An additional premium option enabling federated submissions to multiple directories at once.
  * Federated submissions are executed via built-in API integrations, incurring no additional cost per platform.

### Content Freshness

* Platforms independently fetch and regenerate content from submitted URLs to ensure uniqueness and mitigate duplicate content penalties.

### Federated Directory Discovery

* API provides functionality to query federated platforms based on specific niche tags or keywords.
* Enables targeted federated submissions, enhancing relevance and improving submission acceptance rates.

### Incentivization Mechanism

* Encourages users to host their own platform instances, enhancing federation and organic reach.
* Badge or recognition system rewarding active and high-quality federation participation.

### Spam and Moderation Controls

* Minimal user verification required (e.g., email confirmation).
* Platform owners retain moderation capabilities to review, approve, or reject submissions.

### Privacy and Permissions

* Clear disclosure of content scraping and AI description generation processes.
* Option for users to edit, update, or delete auto-generated content.

### User Interface and Experience

* Mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA).
* Responsive hamburger menu for navigation on mobile devices.
* Light/dark mode with user-selectable toggle.
* Language selector for internationalization (i18n).

## Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** SvelteKit 2 and Svelte 4 for lightweight, performant UI.
* **Backend and Database:** Supabase Cloud, suitable for API-driven architectures.
* **Deployment:** Dedicated server running Ubuntu 22.04.
* **AI Integration:** Ollama (local) or OpenAI GPT models (cloud-based) for generating unique descriptions.

## Revenue Model

* Directories monetize via:

  * Basic submissions (one-time fee).
  * Premium federated submissions (higher fee for broader exposure).
* Users gain exposure across multiple relevant federated directories with a single transaction.

## User Scenarios

### Single Directory Submission

1. User visits platform.
2. User submits URL and pays one-time fee.
3. System auto-fetches metadata and generates content.
4. Platform owner reviews and approves the submission.

### Federated Submission

1. User visits platform.
2. User selects federated submission option and pays premium fee.
3. User specifies niche tags or keywords to target relevant federated directories.
4. Submission is automatically syndicated to multiple platforms via API.
5. Each platform individually re-fetches URL data and generates unique content.

## Conclusion

This simplified yet powerful federated launch platform capitalizes on ease-of-use, viral distribution through federation, and robust monetization opportunities. Leveraging AI to create unique, optimized content ensures high engagement and organic growth.
